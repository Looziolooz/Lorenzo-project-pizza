# Project Name
The assigned project for this case is a pizzeria where customers can order various types of dishes (Pasta, Pizza or Soup). Once the customer chooses the dish to order, the customer  must enter the age to inform the pizzeria whether the ordered dish is for an adult or a child. Depending on the size of the dish, the price varies: €10 for a child and €15 for an adult. Once the age is entered, the customer must confirm or cancel the order. Upon confirmation of the order, a message confirming the order will appear.

## The problem

For this project, I used the CodePen platform. I downloaded the project guidelines and tried to write the various steps to formulate the variable names and concatenate the commands to execute in the console. I encountered many difficulties during the code development, especially regarding the "age" part. Several times I searched on Google, and on multiple occasions, I followed some suggestions from the AI. I am very satisfied with the result achieved. 
Finally, I decided to embellish the various messages with emojis.
